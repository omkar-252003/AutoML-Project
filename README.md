# 🏆 Multi-Modal Distributed Machine Learning System 🏆

Welcome to the **Multi-Modal Distributed Machine Learning System** project! This repository combines the power of **tabular data** and **image data** using **PyTorch Lightning**, **Ray Tune**, and **distributed computing** strategies. Whether you’re aiming for scalable model training or efficient hyperparameter tuning, this project has you covered. 🚀

## 📚 Overview

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and deploy a multi-modal machine learning model that processes **both tabular and image data**. It leverages distributed training techniques to scale across multiple devices, making it ideal for large datasets. The system is flexible, allowing for hyperparameter tuning, model compression, and deployment.

### Key Features 🌟

- **Multi-Modal Learning:** Integrates **image and tabular data** for enhanced predictions.
- **Distributed Training:** Uses PyTorch Lightning’s **DDP Strategy** to scale training across devices.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Efficient tuning with **Ray Tune**.
- **Model Compression:** Dynamic quantization for efficient deployment.
- **Scalable Deployment:** Ready for real-world applications.

## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/multi-modal-distributed-ml.git
cd multi-modal-distributed-ml
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision pytorch-lightning ray scikit-learn pandas pillow
```

### 3. Organize Your Data 📁

- **Tabular Data:** Should be preprocessed and stored in a CSV file.
- **Images:** Place your images in a designated directory, structured as needed.

## 🧑‍💻 Usage Guide

### 1. Preparing the Dataset

This project assumes tabular data has been preprocessed and is ready to be combined with image data. Modify the `MultiModalDataset` class as necessary to match your data structure.

### 2. Training the Model

**Single-Device Training:**

```bash
python train_single.py
```

**Distributed Training:**

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=2 train_distributed.py
```

*Adjust `nproc_per_node` to specify the number of devices.*

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning 🔧

Use **Ray Tune** for distributed hyperparameter tuning:

```bash
python hyperparam_tune.py
```

### 4. Compress and Deploy

Run the following command to compress the trained model for deployment:

```bash
python compress_and_save.py
```
